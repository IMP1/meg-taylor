                We were deluged <br>
                and washed with the waters of Noah's flood <br>
                we were soaked through <br>
                to the skin of our hearts
            </p>
            <p>
                Longing for a landscape <br>
                this side of the border of tears <br>
                doesn't work <br>
                longing to hold on to spring blossom <br>
                longing to remain unscathed <br>
                doesn't work
            </p>
            <p>
                What works is to ask <br>
                please <br>
                that at sunrise the dove <br>
                will bring the olive branch <br>
                that the fruit will be as colourful <br>
                as the blossom <br>
                that even the rose petals on the ground <br>
                can become a shining crown
            </p>
            <p>
                And that we, out of the flood <br>
                out of the lions den and the <br>
                fiery furnace <br>
                will be released <br>
                renewing ourselves <br>
                even more wounded and even more healed.

                We must be able to go away <br>

                rooted in the earth <br>

                We must hold our breath <br>

                until the play of light and shade <br>
                of green and blue <br>
                shows the old pattern <br>
                and we are home <br>

                and able to sit down and lean against it <br>
                as if it were the gravestone of <br>
                our mother.

                I wish to write <br>
                in clear letters <br>
                on a dry riverbed <br>
                a white ribbon of pebbles <br>
                seen from afar <br>
                or a scree slope <br>
                rubble <br>
                sliding under my lines <br>
                slipping away <br>
                so that the however <br>
                of the thorny life of my words <br>
                be the however of each letter.
            </p>

                Little letters <br>
                precise ones <br>
                so that the words come quietly <br>
                so that the words sneak in <br>
                so that you have to go there <br>
                towards the words <br>
                to look for them in the white <br>
                paper <br>
                quietly <br>
                you don't notice them entering <br>
                through the pores <br>
                sweat that runs inwards
            </p>

                screams in black letters <br>
                demands the impossible <br>

                of the great Eskimobird <br>
                seeking its course <br>
                like a hesitant plane.

                a multi-formed animal, <br>
                sit on the tail of the bird <br>
                and fly with me <br>
                overarching me <br>
                and my breath <br>
                can't escape you. <br>

                like jellyfish <br>
                that are going to be swept out again. <br>

                the water comes <br>
                and ploughs small furrows on to me. <br>
                But the wind <br>

                behind the ribcage - <br>
                and it burns the skin of my heart <br>

                A little house <br>
                with a white wall <br>
                for the evening sun <br>
                and a well to be a mirror <br>
                for the moon <br>
                so that it doesn't <br>
                get lost <br>
                over the sea. <br>
                A house <br>
                near an apple tree <br>
                or an olive tree <br>
                where the wind <br>
                will go by <br>
                like a hunter whose quarry <br>

                is that which smelt sweetly of today.

            <p>
                Pain coffins us in <br>
                in a house without windows. <br>
                The sun which opens the flowers <br>
                shows its edges <br>
                even more clearly. <br>
                It is a die of silence <br>
                in the night.

                Comfort <br>

                and wants to come in <br>
                bitterly gathers kindling. <br>
                It wants to force a miracle <br>
                and sets fire to <br>
                the house of pain.

            <p>
                Whoever meets it <br>
                will be lifted up <br>
                as if by a huge crane <br>
                and set down <br>
                where nothing holds true  <br>
                where no road <br>
                leads from yesterday to tomorrow. <br>
                Buttons, jewellery and colour <br>
                will be swept <br>
                with a broom  <br>
                from his clothes. <br>
                Then he will be stripped <br>
                and put on show. <br>
                Hostile hands <br>
                feel his hips. <br>
                He's pressure cooked <br>
                in tears <br>
                in the slow kitchens of time <br>
                until the flesh <br>
                on his bones becomes tender. <br>
                He gets pressed through the finest <br>
                sieves of pain <br>
                and strained through  <br>
                pitiless cloths <br>
                which let nothing through <br>
                and on which the last grain of  <br>
                self respect <br>
                is left behind. <br>
                He gets chosen <br>
                and punished <br>
                and is made to eat the dust <br>
                off the soles of the disappointed <br>
                on all the country lanes of betrayal <br>
                and as it's harvest time <br>
                his blood <br>
                shall fertilise the large vines <br>
                and protect them from the frost.
            </p>
            <p>
                But sometimes <br>
                if he is lucky <br>
                (though through no understandable <br>
                merit <br>
                just as he was not put outside <br>
                for any known fault <br>
                but simply because he was on hand) <br>
                he will be reprieved <br>
                by the unknown <br>
                all powerful judge <br>
                as long as there is time. <br>
                Then he gets rediscovered <br>
                like a new continent <br>
                or a crucifix <br>
                after an air-raid <br>
                in a rubble filled shelter. <br>
                It's as though the points are set <br>
                his nowhere <br>
                is coupled  <br>
                to the old landscape <br>
                like a carriage shunted <br>
                on to a train <br>
                from a dead end. <br>
                Under the rainbowed gate <br>
                on a certain day of the calendar <br>
                that is thick with future <br>
                a tender yesterday <br>
                recognises him and opens its arms <br>
                to receive him.
            </p>
            <p>
                No cat with nine lives <br>
                no lizard and no starfish <br>
                whose lost limb grows back <br>
                no severed worm <br>
                is as tough as the man <br>
                who has been placed <br>
                in the sun <br>
                of love and hope. <br>
                His fear fades <br>
                like the marks of the branding iron <br>
                or the scars of the wounds <br>
                from his body. <br>
                His defoliated <br>
                tree of joy <br>
                grows new shoots <br>
                and even the bark of trust <br>
                slowly grows back. <br>
                He gets used to the altered <br>
                ploughed image <br>
                in the mirror <br>
                he oils his skin <br>
                and covers the impudent <br>
                skeleton man <br>
                with a new layer of fat <br>
                until he no longer <br>
                smells strange <br>
                to everyone. <br>
                And quite unremarked <br>
                maybe on a holiday <br>
                or on a birthday <br>
                he no longer sits  <br>
                only on the edge <br>
                of the offered chair <br>
                as if on the run <br>
                or as if it has <br>
                wormeaten legs <br>
                but he sits <br>
                with his kin at the table <br>
                and is at home <br>
                and almost  <br>
                safe <br>
                and delights in  <br>
                the gifts <br>
                and loves what is borrowed <br>
                more than what is owned <br>
                and every day <br>
                is for him <br>
                surprisingly present <br>
                so luminously light <br>
                and clearly bordered <br>
                like the span <br>
                between the outspread <br>
                pinions <br>
                of a gliding bird.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fearful time lag <br>
                of the test <br>
                sinks in. <br>
                The turnpikes <br>
                on all frontiers <br>
                are moved back <br>
                into brightness. <br>
                But the substance <br>
                of the self <br>
                is as altered <br>
                as the metal that comes out of the furnace. <br>
                Or it's as if <br>
                from the tenth or twentieth floor <br>
                - the difference is marginal <br>
                for a <em>salto mortale</em> <br>
                without a safety net - <br>
                he's fallen on his feet <br>
                in the middle of Times Square <br>
                and has escaped <br>
                the muzzles of the oncoming cars <br>
                by the skin of his teeth <br>
                just before the lights turn red. <br>
                And so a certain <br>
                birdlike lightness <br>
                has stayed with him. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                But you <br>
                who meet him <br>
                on every street <br>
                you who break <br>
                bread with him <br>
                bend down and stroke  <br>
                the delicate moss on the ground <br>
                without ruffling it <br>
                stroke the little animal <br>
                without making it flinch. <br>
                Lay your hand protectively <br>
                on the head of a child, <br>
                let it be kissed <br>
                by the tender mouth <br>
                of the beloved, <br>
                or hold it  <br>
                as under a tap <br>
                under the flowing gold <br>
                of the afternoon sun <br>
                so that it becomes transparent <br>
                and completely useless <br>
                at lending a hand <br>
                in the building <br>
                of barbed wire hells <br>
                whether public <br>
                or intimate <br>
                and so that it never <br>
                calls out "me too" <br>
                when panic is handing out  <br>
                its fearful weapons <br>
                and never <br>
                gets to hold <br>
                the great iron rod <br>
                that cuts through <br>
                the Other <br>
                as through foam. <br>
                And that it never <br>
                comes home to you <br>
                in the evening <br>
                like a retriever <br>
                with a pheasant <br>
                or a little hare <br>
                the booty of its instinct <br>
                laying for you <br>
                the skin of a you <br>
                on your table.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                So that <br />
                when on the last day <br>
                it lies before you <br>
                on the bedspread <br>
                like a pale flower <br>
                faded <br>
                but not quite as light <br>
                and not quite as pure <br>
                but like a human hand <br>
                which gets stained <br>
                and washed <br>
                and stained again <br>
                you thank it <br>
                and say <br>
                farewell my hand. <br>
                You were a loving  <br>
                link <br>
                between me and the world.

                When your suburbs are the ends of the world
            </p>
            <p>
                you know the smell <br>

                they open <br>
                and you go in <br>
                not <br>
                into breadth <br>
                into a different narrowness.

            <p>
                Out of your door <br>
                and then where to? <br>
                Don't you make yourself at home <br>
                like everyone else <br>
                lonely <br>
                like everyone else <br>
                in the jaws of the tiger?
            </p>
            <p>
                No, there is no time <br>
                for adventure.

            </p>
            <p>
                this is not it the conveyor belt which we are glued to <br>
                from our manufacture in the womb <br>
                from our packaging in <br>
                boxes of all sizes and kinds <br>
                together with others <br>
                and at last in the smallest <br>
                darkest <br>
                alone <br>
                in the smallest single cell <br>
                as tight as the womb as windowless
            </p>
            <p>
                we are used to it
            </p>
            <p>
                Didn't someone say <br>
                these people and those people <br>
                "are used to being tortured"

                the deal is made on the bed sheets <br>

                You get turned on a blue sphere <br>
                head first from light into darkness <br>
                without noticing <br>
                like the conveyor belt <br>

                you forget it in nice weather <br>
                the smallest conveyor belt is it <br>
                this is not visible <br>
                this isn't signed <br>

                I am still higher up on the rim <br>
                said an overseer in the concentration camp <br>
                to those people still alive <br>
                people who shovelled their own pit <br>
                before their execution <br>
                said he the executioner <br>
                You are nearer the rim
            </p>
            <p>
                No one knows how near we are to the rim <br>
                that it turns <br>
                it turns itself <br>
                he was above and shoved them down <br>
