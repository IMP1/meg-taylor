            <h1>Wait for Nothing</h1>
            <p>
                From the sky tree <br>
                the clouds have fallen to earth. <br>
                The land is dappled <br>
                with large dark leaves.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the streets of the sad <br>
                the window frames <br>
                are painted in the colour of the sky <br>
                in the colour of the sun <br>
                in the lightless houses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pigeon lofts on the roofs <br>
                for a light feathered yesterday <br>
                that never returns.
            </p>
            <p>
                Only the ringing at the edge of the wood <br>
                ripples from little bells <br>
                right into the room. <br>
                Take your shoes off <br>
                bathe your feet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wait for nothing <br>
                only the ringing <br>
                of the little bells <br>
                at the edge of the wood.

                as if the wings <br>

                It must be kept <br>
                as it came out of grey times

                people like us, we amongst them <br>
                sailed on ships to and fro <br>
                and could land nowhere

            <p>
                people like us, we amongst them <br>
                forbidden to stay <br>

            <p>
                people like us, we amongst them <br>
                didn't greet our friends <br>
                and were not greeted
            </p>
            <p>
                people like us, we amongst them <br>
                stood on foreign shores <br>
                begging forgiveness for being
            </p>
            <p>
                people like us, we amongst them <br>
                were saved
            </p>
            <p>
                people like us, we amongst them <br>
                people like you, you amongst them <br>
                everyone
            </p>
            <p>
                can be stripped <br>
                and made nude <br>
                the nude doll people
            </p>
            <p>
                more nude than animal bodies <br>
                beneath the clothes <br>
                the body of the victim
            </p>
            <p>
                stripped <br>
                those who still have their shell around them in the morning <br>
                white bodies
            </p>
            <p>
                lucky were those only <br>
                shoved <br>
                from pole to pole

                from which nothing separates us but <br>
                twenty years
            </p>
            <p>
                The tops of the newspapers <br>
                red and black <br>
                under the word 'German'
            </p>
            <p>
                I saw it once before <br>
                twenty years:
            </p>
            <p>
                on Monday a lot on Tuesday nothing <br>
                between
            </p>
            <p>
                us and the grey times
            </p>

            <p class="poem">3</p>
            <p>
                Sometimes I see you
            </p>
            <p>
                torn apart by wild animals <br>
                by human animals
            </p>
            <p>
                We laugh perhaps
            </p>
            <p>
                Your fear that I never saw <br>
                this fear <br>
                I see you
            </p>

                The dead stand by kiosks <br>
                and look at the tops of the newspapers <br>
                with big eyes <br>
                black and red printed hatred <br>
                under the word 'German' <br>
                The dead are afraid

                We sit on a train <br>
                no one asks if we <br>
                want to get off <br>
                and we move towards a bridge <br>
                and the bridge will break <br>
                This bridge or the next <br>
                will break

                How much you hurt me <br>
                how much I hurt you <br>
                as we are travelling <br>
                in such a hurry <br>
                towards a bridge - <br>
                that won't hold

                silence <br>
                relaxed <br>

                The faster white of the seagull <br>

                in wide curves <br>

                unremittingly caressing <br>
                strokes over your eternal heart and <br>
                doesn't pause <br>
                and pushes the hours away <br>
                from the clockface of your coastline

            <p>With its index finger of shadow and gold <br>
                it directs the birds to silence <br>
                in the wide palm basket of the night <br>
                and cancels the gift of today  <br>
                the tenderly short <br>
                blossom-holiday <br>
                of the light mimosas

                A golden leaf <br>
                it floats towards me <br>
                I want nothing in the world but this leaf <br>
                I stand still <br>
                and open my hand <br>
                A light wind <br>
                The leaf becomes a butterfly <br>
                I become the hunter <br>
                I haven't got a net <br>
                I'd have to go on the grass <br>
                to catch it <br>
                I daren't
            </p>
            <p>I beg the leaf I beg the wind <br>
                I take a little step <br>
                and hold my hand out <br>
                The golden leaf <br>
                and my hand <br>
                miss each other <br>
                a bit - a lot <br>
                it's all the same <br>
                The leaf is a yellow <br>
                dry leaf <br>
                one of the wilted leaves <br>
                in the grass <br>
                of a blue November day
